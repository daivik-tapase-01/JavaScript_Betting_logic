# JavaScript Betting Logic

### Overview

This project implements a simple betting game in JavaScript. Users can place bets on game outcomes, and the logic randomly determines the result, allowing users to win or lose based on their wagers. This game can serve as a foundation for more complex betting systems.
## Features

- User Balance Management: Tracks user balance and updates it upon winning or losing a bet.
- Random Game Outcome: Simulates a simple game with two possible outcomes: Heads or Tails.
- Win/Loss Logic: Simple win/loss mechanism with a 1:1 payout structure.
- Console Output: Displays messages for bet placement, wins, losses, and current balance.
